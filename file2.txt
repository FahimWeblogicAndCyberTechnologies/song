Verse 1:
I woke up this morning, and I felt so alone
I tried to call you, but you never answered the phone
I feel so lost without you, I can't make it on my own
I wish you were here, but now I'm on my own

Chorus:
Why did you leave me, why did you go?
You were the one that I loved, now I'm all alone
I wish I could turn back time, and make it all right
But now you're gone, and I'm left with this fight

Verse 2:
I see your face in everything I do
I can't get you out of my mind, no matter how hard I try to
I know I made mistakes, but I never meant to hurt you
Now I'm paying the price, for everything that I put you through

Chorus:
Why did you leave me, why did you go?
You were the one that I loved, now I'm all alone
I wish I could turn back time, and make it all right
But now you're gone, and I'm left with this fight

Bridge:
I'm trying to move on, but it's so hard to do
I wish I could forget, but I can't get over you
I hope someday you'll forgive me, and we can start anew
But until then, I'll keep on missing you

Chorus:
Why did you leave me, why did you go?
You were the one that I loved, now I'm all alone
I wish I could turn back time, and make it all right
But now you're gone, and I'm left with this fight

Outro:
I'm sitting here alone, with nothing left to do
I hope someday you'll come back, and I'll be with you.
